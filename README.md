# PP2_Assignment1B
An assignment where we created the Savings Account class to hold a balance and calculate/add interest to the balance. We then took user input, created an account, and then looped through a year of simulated interest, prompting the user to input the amount they added/removed from the account each month and spit on the balance of the account at the end of the year.
Made in Eclipse/Java, src will be the raw code, bin is compiled.
